# Yebr Experimental 
These services are experimental, we are still developing them or testing them out.
### `audio-fingerprinting`
We are testing out dejavu. which fingerprints audio files and saves them into a SQL database
(In the future we will be using a embedding search algorighim and a Approximate nearest neighbour algorighim to find if two songs are the same. )
This will help Yebr find song metadata from other platforms only by scraping audio from websites.

Fingerprinting will also help us making a intelligent search where. users will be able to hum aur (shazam) to search for songs.
